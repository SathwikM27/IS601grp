Delicious Chinese, I really like the chicken and broccoli here, good price too with fair portions, highly recommended for pickup and eating out great experience eating in store also. Workers there take pride in their food and it shows in the taste.

Excellent and expedient service and the food exceeded that! Delicious entrees seasoned perfectly, numerous gluten-free options. Authentic is right! And donâ€™t forget the churros for dessert- amazing!

This Chinese restaurant is a gem! The flavors are incredible and the portions are generous. The staff is friendly and attentive. I highly recommend trying their General Tso's chicken and fried rice.
